            <p><strong>About Vastu Errors Fix</strong></p>
            <p class="m-3">Staying at home during the lockdown period is a great opportunity to fix Vastu errors and ensure good health and peace of mind. Most Indian homes follow architectural guidelines, from laying foundation stones to decorating their interiors with furniture. </p>
            <p><strong>Household appliances:</strong></p>
            <p class="m-3">Appliances used for heating should always be placed in the south-east of the room. Fridges should be placed in the northwest part of the room, while TV sets can go anywhere in the northeast part of the room.</p>
            <p><strong>Dining table:</strong></p>
            <p class="m-3">If placed in the kitchen, the dining table should be placed in the northwest section and placed in such a way that the seating owner or the eldest person faces the north or east and the guest faces south or west while dining.</p>

            <p><strong>Bed:</strong></p>
            <p class="m-3">A bedroom is a place for rest and revitalization, and hence the location of the bed is important according to Vastu. It should be placed towards the southwestern part of the room but not in the southwest corner. While sleeping, one should keep one’s head towards the south for better sleep and health.</p>

            <p><strong>Mirrors:</strong></p>
            <p class="m-3">Mirrors should not be put on opposite beds in the study room or bedroom. They should only be placed on the north and east walls.</p>
            <center><img src="https://teja10.kuikr.com/restatic/uploads/2020/11/Vastu-for-mirrors.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid"></center>
            <p><strong>Study Table:</strong></p>
            <p class="m-3">The study table should be placed in the south-west of the room so that the person facing north or east should raise attention while studying.</p>
            <p><strong>Almirah:</strong></p>
            <p class="m-3">These should be set in the southwest of the room and if they hold valuables, then it is perfect to put them in the southwest part of the room. They should be put so that they open towards the east or north.</p>
            <p><strong>Sofa Set:</strong></p>
            <p class="m-3">Furniture like sofas and chairs should be put in the south and western part of the living room. The chair on which the lord of the house or the eldest person sits should face the south or west direction.</p>
            <p><strong>Shoe Racks:</strong></p>
            <p class="m-3">Footwear shoe racks should never be stored in the southwest part of the main hall or verandah and in the bedroom. Never put shoes in the south-east, north, or east part of the house.</p>
            <p><strong>Internal Plants:</strong></p>
            <p class="m-3">Vastu rules say that cactus or related flora, bonsai trees, and red flowering plants should not be kept indoors. The north-east corner of the house should be without plants and pots should not be placed along the north and east walls.</p>
            <center><img src="https://teja10.kuikr.com/restatic/uploads/2020/11/Vastu-for-interior-plants.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid"></center>
            <p><strong>Fish Tank and Fountain:</strong></p>
            <p class="m-3">These beautiful pieces should never be kept in the bedroom and studied.</p>
            <p><strong>Arts and Paintings:</strong></p>
            <p class="m-3">To keep the North East clean and light, Vastu suggests keeping that area free from paintings or anything else. War scenes, violence, nudity, evil and complex paintings should be avoided with painted colors. The idols of the gods should not be placed in the bedroom and the heavy idols should not be placed in the north-east corner of the room. Stuffed animals should not be kept anywhere in the house.</p>
            <p class="m-3">When presenting one’s interior, organize things that please the eyes and the mind. Decorative pieces should be able to shape the artistic and cultural looks of a house and give a soothing background to the inmates.</p>
